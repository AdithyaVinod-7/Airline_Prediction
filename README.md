# Airline Price Prediction

The airline industry is considered as one of the most sophisticated industries in using complex pricing strategies. Now-a-days flight prices are quite unpredictable. The ticket prices change frequently. Customers are seeking to get the lowest price for their ticket, while airline companies are trying to keep their overall revenue as high as possible. Airlines use sophisticated tactics, which they call "revenue management". 

Optimal timing for airline ticket purchasing from the consumerâ€™s perspective is challenging principally because buyers have insufficient information for reasoning about future price movements.

Using Predictive Analytics, it is possible to reduce the uncertainty of flight prices. So here we will be predicting the flight prices using efficient machine learning techniques.
